# [Kafka] for [Drupal] 8

[Kafka]: https://kafka.apache.org/
[Drupal]:  https://drupal.org/


## Features

* Drupal 8 [Queue API] backend. Queue names map to Kafka topics.
  * Standard Drush commands to consume the queue: `drush queue-list` / `drush queue-run` 
* (planned): [PSR-3] Log appender. Logger channels map to Kafka topics.
* Drush commands to check proper operation of the high-level consumer, low-level
  consumer, and producer in relation with a Kafka instance, e.g.  check IP / 
  port / credentials

Based on [`php_rdkafka`] / [`librdkafka`].

[Queue API]: https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21core.api.php/group/queue/8.2.x


## License

Like any Drupal plugin, the module is licensed under the General Public License,
version 2.0 or later (SPDX: GPL-2.0+).


## Install

* Install the Drupal 8 site without the module.
* Get access and topic information for a Kafka 0.10 broker.
* Install the `librdkafka` client library.
* Install the `php-rdkafka` PHP extension version 1 or 2 (see "Requirements" for details). In 2016-11, this means building from sources.
* Install the module as usual
* Configure Drupal `settings.php` to expose the Kafka queue, either as the default queue backend, or for specific queue names:

        $settings['queue_default'] = 'queue.kafka';
        $settings['queue_service_{queue_name}'] = 'queue.kafka';

## Requirements

* Drupal 8.2.0 or later
* Apache Kafka 0.10.1.0 or later
* `libradkafka`
* `php-rdkafka` master 2016-11-01 or more recent
  * 2.0.0 or later for PHP 7.x
  * 1.0.0 or later for PHP 5.6.x
  * 0.9.1 is __NOT__ usable
* PHP 5.6.27 or more recent. Slightly earlier versions _might_ work but have not been evaluated

## Limitations

At this point:
 
  * The module does _not_ provide a "reliable" queue service in the Drupal sense
    (`ReliableQueueInterface`). See Kafka documentation about why this is so: 
    the exact reliability guarantees provided depend on the Kafka topic 
    configuration.
  * Using the module during site installation is not supported.
  
Topics handling:

  * In production instances, automatic topic creation/deletion is usually not
    enabled, for various reasons, so they need to be created and deleted out of 
    band. 
  * On development instances, you may configure automatic topic creation/deletion.
